# ha-dashboard

Hi and welcome to my Home Assistant Dashboard Github page.<br>
Here I will be sharing code for my dashboard cards.

My dashboard is mainly built on <a href="https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom" target="_blank">Mushroom cards</a>, so you will need to install that to use the cards.<br>
You will also need <a href="https://github.com/ofekashery/vertical-stack-in-card" target="_blank">Vertical Stack-in card</a> and <a href="https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod" target="_blank">Card-mod</a>.

Room card:<br>

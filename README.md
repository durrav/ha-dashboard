# ha-dashboard

Hi and welcome to my Home Assistant Dashboard Github page.
Here I will be sharing code for my dashboard cards.

My dashboard is mainly built on Mushroom cards, so you will need to install that to use the cards. 
You will also need https://github.com/ofekashery/vertical-stack-in-card and https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod.

# ha-dashboard

Hi and welcome to my Home Assistant Dashboard Github page.<br>
Here I will be sharing code for my dashboard cards.

My dashboard is mainly built on <a href="https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom">Mushroom cards</a>, so you will need to install that to use the cards.<br>
You will also need <a href="https://github.com/ofekashery/vertical-stack-in-card">Vertical Stack-in card</a> and <a href="https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod">Card-mod</a>.

<h2>Included cards:</h2><br>

- Room card
